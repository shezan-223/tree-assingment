(1) var is  old way variable .we can redeclare it as much we can . now a days we dont use it anymore because it can give us bug

on the other hand , let is much mordern variable .we cant not redeclare it  but can update the value.

const is just like let. it is mordern also cant redeclare. but we can't update the value.



(2) forEach() is a loop and it doesn't return anyhting .


map() its also a loop but it creats a new array 

filter() Loops over the array creates a new array  items that pass a test 


(3)  this is a arrow function 
const add = (a, b) => a + b; 
its is short and easy





(4)
this is destructuring  works

const [first, second, third] = [10, 20, 30]

console.log(first, second, third) 



(5)Template literals  are  a new way to work with strings in JavaScript.
Theyâ€™re written using backticks (`) .
